## Features  
âœ… **Add Employees**: Register new employees with name, department, and salary.  
âœ… **Manage Departments**: Automatically creates departments if they donâ€™t exist.  
âœ… **View Employees**: List all employees along with their department and salary.  
âœ… **Persistent Storage**: Uses **SQLite** for storing employee and department data.
